The assignment was to make a news site using some of the most common structures and layouts. The site should also look different depensing on if the viewer's using a mobile, tablet or desktop.

The problem
I started with watching the videos from Technigo. When there was things I didn't understand, like how to "name" different divs to be able to connect them in css, I used w3schools.com a lot.
For the logo I used an ai logo creator. 
I'm not a structured planner, so I just let inspiration come from different places all at once. The site just grew from a background, an h1, maybe a picture could be fun..

My biggest problem was the responsive design. I looked at the Technigo-video several times, googled, looked it up on youtube, asked on slack and Chatgpt but couldn't figure it out. After having tried the tips from youtube, google etc. for two whole days, I finally got in touch with Diego at Technigo and he was able to help me! 

If I had more time I'd spend some of it to make the background look more "professional", I don't think the background on my site looks professional, but I really like the colors :)
I'd also spend some time trying to figure out how to not make the logo flip like the rest of the pictures. I want it to remain the same. 
And, also something I've spent quite alot of time on, but I guess is really simple, is to make the section with the big news centered on the page!
