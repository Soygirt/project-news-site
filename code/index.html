      <h2>Man sees troll!</h2>
      <p>
        It was a late afternoon when Kalle på Berget (Kalle Svensson) was walking his dog. He heard a strange noise in
        the woods close
        to
        the gravel road and went to investigate. When he had walked 200 meters into the forest he heard the noise
        again.
        His
        dog started barking at what he first thought was a rock, but when the rock started moving he saw that it was in
        fact a troll! Haven't heard of trolls? Click <a

        <h4>Atm-machine</h4>
        <p>The village has now got an ATM machine! We no longer have to go to Arvika to use the ATM, thanks to Ica Nära
          Glava
          who's
          just installed a new one right in the middle of Glava. The machine comes in perfect timing, since all Sweden
          is
          going more and more digitalized, and fewer people use actual money anymore.</p>

        <h4>Glaskogen is on fire</h4>
        <p>No, not on actual fire! But it's a super hot destination for tourists, and Glaskogen is now breaking the
          visiting
          records from last year. Tourists say they mainly come to explore the forest, bring home some moose poop, and
          to experience the Glava wilderness. Many seems to appreciate the beaver safaris at the local swimming spots.

        <h4>Read the locals thoughts about the tourists</h4>
        <p>What does the locas think about all the tourists coming to Glaskogen?
          After having interviewed half of the population (8 people, to be precise) we can now inform that most of the
          locals like having the tourists here. "They bring jobs to the village" one woman says. Some are not as happy.
          Rav-Olle (pictured above) says "The tourists are stealing all the poop! There's no moose poop to be found in
          the forest nowadays. I've had to change the beads for my bracelets from moose- to dog poop. It stinks!"
