      <h2>Man sees troll!</h2>
      <p>It was a late afternoon when Alf Simonsson was walking his dog. He heard a strange noise in the woods close
        to
        the gravel road and went to investigate. When he had walked 200 meters into the forest he heard the noise
        again.
        His
        dog started barking at what he first thought was a rock but when the rock started moving he saw that it was in
        fact a troll! Haven't heard of trolls? Click <a

      <h4>Atm-machine</h4>
      <p>The village has got an ATM machine! We no longer have to go to Arvika to use the ATM, thanks to Ica NÃ¤ra
        who's
        just installed a new one right in the middle of Glava. The machine comes in perfect timing, since all Sweden
        is
        going more and more digitalized, and fewer people use actual money anymore.</p>
